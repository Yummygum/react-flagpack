Flagpack for React is created using React v16.8. The Flagpack component has not been tested for compatibility with older versions of React.

## Installation

```bash
$: npm install react-flagpack --save
```

This package depends on the files being injected into the static folder of the project.
React flagpack comes bundled with a CLI that will do this automatically for you, but you have to tell node to execute it.

Add the following to the scripts in package.json

```json
  "postinstall": "react-flagpack"
```


This tool accepts the parameter "--framework" which can be used to pass the correct framework to it.
The default selected framework supports NextJS, create-react-app, Remix.

For Gastby support please provide the `--framework gatsby` option
